# Here is an example of how to use the CouchDB Source Adapter
# NOTE it is essential that all of your models utilizing the CouchDB adapter
# should include the following setting:
# 	enable :full_update
#
# This is to make sure that the revision column is available for all updates

class Product < CouchAdapter

  def initialize(source,credential)
    # Place the base url for your couch db in the @base variable
    @base = "http://127.0.0.1:5984"
    # Place the name of the database that you will be connecting to in the @db variable
    @db = "products"
    super(source,credential)
  end
  
  def create_id(create_hash)
    id = "#{create_hash['brand']}#{create_hash['name']}"
  end

end
